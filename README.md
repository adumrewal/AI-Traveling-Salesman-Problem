# AI_TSP
A project in AI to generate an efficient solution for a TSP(max. 500 nodes). TL: 5 minutes

The algorithm first generates multiple paths by choosing one starting vertex and then travelling the nearest neighbours one by one. After each path is generated it applies hill clibing along with temperature gradient to generate paths of possibly shorter lengths.
